Claude i have this wild idea: i own mockfactory.io, check it out:

= support our oauth2 and accounts
- support php,python,perl,html,js,node,go, shell
- DO NOT ALLOW ROOT
- DO NOT ALLOW system aCCESS
- 15 free runs total; 5 without account, 10 after account made
- after dark sysstems employees get unlimited runs
= implement container escape detection
- everuthing i did not think about to monetize it
- stripe integration
